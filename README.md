# Welcome to my portfolio's code!

The website is still pretty much under construction, as I'm trying to add a new feature whenever I find time (hopefully, at least once a week). You can expect a list of all the things I've done since I started my career as a software developer (and, perhaps, even stuff unrelated to developing software)

## TODO
* --Push first commit--
* --Create info panel--
* --List latest projects--
* --Add WebGL background--
* --Add GitHub Pages workflow--
* --Fix mobile layout issues--
* --Add README.md--
* Add animations
* Add icon
* Update background, so it actually does something
* Add summary of experience
* Add contact links
